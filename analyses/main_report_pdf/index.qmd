# Preface

The objectives for this report were the following:

- Data-driven cell model system selection for wetlab target characterization and validation
- Sketching a data selection, analysis, and filtering strategy to establish a lead on a drug target in the liver cancer space for further exploration

Guiding Principles:

- Bioinformatics ideally is designed with collaboration in mind from the bottom up
- Whenever possible, scorable metrics are to be created to enable future automation using recent ideas by [Aygun et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06503)
- Data, raw and analysed, should be shareable and easily available for co-workers within the organization. Ideally, through APIs with appropriate access control, as [spearheaded by Jeff Bezos in 2002](https://nordicapis.com/the-bezos-api-mandate-amazons-manifesto-for-externalization/)
- Reports should be actionable for everyone, from domain experts to software engineers
