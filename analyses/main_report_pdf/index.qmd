# Preface

The objectives of this report are the following:
    - Data-driven model system selection for target characterization and validation
    - A rational strategy to find a drug target for further exploration

Principles:
    - Whenever possible, scorable metrics are to be used to enable future automation
    - Reports should be actionable for everyone from domain expert to software engineer
    - Designed from the bottom up for collaboration. In [this github repository](https://github.com/decusInLabore/targetreport) instructions can be found on how to setup the singularity, renv and venv environment that was used to underpin this report.
