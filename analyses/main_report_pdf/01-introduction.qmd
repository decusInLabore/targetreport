## Data download and wrangling
The code for data download and wrangling is part of the code supplement, but ommited in this summary report. 

## Part A: Examination of a drug candidate
In this example the histon-methyltransferase EZH2 is investigated. However, the analysis is written in modular form so it can be used as a template for any gene. 

## Part B: Evaluation of a drug discovery strategy 
In this example a preliminary examination of a liver oncology target is made. Also this analysis is written in modular form, so it can be used as a template for any such analysis.
